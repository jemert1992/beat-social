Social Media Content Automation Prompt for Manus AI
Project Overview
Create an automated system to generate and post engaging content for TikTok and Instagram in a user-specified niche. The system allows the user to select a niche (e.g., weddings, fitness, travel) and set a daily posting frequency (e.g., 1‚Äì3 posts per platform). It analyzes trending content in the niche to inform content creation, using simple assets like stock images, AI-generated visuals, or basic video edits. The system automates content generation, caption creation, hashtag selection, and scheduling/posting, with a focus on simplicity and platform optimization. A weekly performance report helps refine future content.
Requirements
1. User Inputs

Niche Selection: Allow the user to specify a niche (e.g., weddings, fitness, travel) via a simple text input or dropdown menu.
Posting Frequency: Let the user set the number of posts per day for each platform (e.g., 1‚Äì3 posts for TikTok, 1‚Äì2 for Instagram).
Content Preferences: Optionally allow the user to specify preferences (e.g., favor quotes, short videos, or carousels) or default to a balanced mix.

2. Content Analysis

Trend Analysis: Scrape or reference trending content in the specified niche on TikTok (e.g., via TikTok Creative Center) and Instagram (e.g., via Explore page or public APIs).
Identify high-engagement posts (e.g., likes, comments, shares) in the niche.
Note content types (e.g., quote images, short videos, tutorials) and themes (e.g., for weddings: bridal tips, romantic quotes, venue showcases).


Adaptation: Use trending formats as templates but create original content to avoid duplication (e.g., similar aesthetic or tone but unique text/images).

3. Content Creation

Asset Types:
Use stock images from free platforms (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels) or AI-generated visuals (e.g., via MidJourney, Canva, or DALL¬∑E).
Create short videos (15‚Äì30 seconds) using stock footage or AI-generated clips with text overlays.
Include text-based content like quotes or tips, styled with niche-appropriate fonts/colors.


Content Formats:
TikTok: Prioritize vertical videos (1080x1920) or image slideshows with music and text overlays, aligned with trending sounds.
Instagram: Focus on polished images, carousels, or Reels, optimized for 1080x1350 (posts) or 1080x1920 (Reels).


Simplicity: Avoid complex production (e.g., no custom shoots or heavy editing). Use templates or pre-built tools for efficiency.
Branding: Ensure consistent niche-appropriate aesthetics (e.g., soft pastels for weddings, vibrant colors for fitness).

4. Captions and Hashtags

Captions: Generate engaging, niche-specific captions (e.g., for weddings: ‚ÄúDreaming of your perfect day? üíç #WeddingInspo‚Äù).
Keep captions short (50‚Äì100 characters for TikTok, 100‚Äì150 for Instagram).
Include a call-to-action (e.g., ‚ÄúFollow for more wedding tips!‚Äù).


Hashtags: Select 5‚Äì10 niche-relevant hashtags based on trending and high-engagement tags (e.g., #WeddingPlanning, #BrideToBe).
Mix broad and niche-specific hashtags for reach and targeting.



5. Automation and Scheduling

Posting: Automatically schedule and post content to TikTok and Instagram using their APIs or a third-party tool (e.g., Buffer, Later).
Adhere to user-specified posting frequency and platform best practices (e.g., optimal posting times: 7‚Äì9 PM for TikTok, 11 AM‚Äì2 PM for Instagram).


Error Handling: Include checks for posting failures (e.g., API errors) and notify the user if manual intervention is needed.

6. Performance Tracking

Metrics: Track engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, views) for each post.
Weekly Report: Generate a simple report (e.g., PDF or text) summarizing:
Top-performing posts (by engagement).
Insights on what worked (e.g., ‚ÄúQuote images outperformed videos this week‚Äù).
Recommendations for future content (e.g., ‚ÄúIncrease use of trending wedding hashtags‚Äù).


Feedback Loop: Use performance data to prioritize successful content types/formats in future posts.

Technical Specifications

Platform: Build as a web-based tool or script compatible with Manus AI‚Äôs environment.
Dependencies:
Image/Video Tools: Integrate with Unsplash/Pexels APIs, Canva API, or AI image generators.
Social Media APIs: Use TikTok and Instagram APIs for posting and trend analysis.
Scheduling: Integrate with Buffer, Later, or similar for automated posting.


Data Storage: Store user inputs, content schedules, and performance data in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or Supabase).
Scalability: Ensure the system can handle multiple niches or accounts if expanded later.

Output Format

User Interface: Provide a simple dashboard or CLI for inputting niche, posting frequency, and viewing reports.
Content Output: Save generated content (images/videos) and metadata (captions, hashtags) in a folder structure (e.g., /niche/date/platform).
Report: Deliver weekly performance report as a downloadable file or email.

Example Workflow (Wedding Niche)

User selects ‚Äúweddings‚Äù and sets 2 posts/day for TikTok, 1 post/day for Instagram.
System analyzes trending wedding content (e.g., romantic quote images, bridal prep videos).
Generates content: a TikTok video with stock footage of a wedding venue and text overlay (‚ÄúTop 5 Venue Tips!‚Äù), an Instagram carousel with AI-generated bouquet images and captions.
Adds captions (‚ÄúPlan your dream wedding! üíê‚Äù) and hashtags (#WeddingInspo, #Bride2025).
Schedules posts for optimal times and tracks engagement.
Weekly report shows quote images had 20% higher engagement, recommends more quote-based content.

Constraints

Keep content creation simple: no custom shoots or complex editing.
Ensure compliance with TikTok/Instagram policies (e.g., no copyrighted music without permission).
Stay within Manus AI‚Äôs processing limits for API calls and content generation.
Avoid overfetching data to minimize costs (e.g., limit trend scraping to top 10‚Äì20 posts).

Success Criteria

System consistently posts user-specified content on schedule.
Content aligns with niche trends and achieves engagement (e.g., 100+ likes/post within 1 week).
Weekly reports provide actionable insights to improve performance.
User can set up and run the system with minimal technical knowledge.
