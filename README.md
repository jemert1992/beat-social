## Usage Examples

### Configure for a Wedding Niche

```python
from src.system import SocialMediaAutomationSystem

system = SocialMediaAutomationSystem("/path/to/base/directory")
system.configure(
    niche="weddings",
    tiktok_frequency=2,
    instagram_frequency=1,
    content_preferences={
        "preferred_content_types": ["showcase", "tutorial"],
        "preferred_themes": ["romantic", "budget_friendly"]
    }
)
```

### Generate and Execute a Content Plan

```python
# Generate a content plan for 7 days
content_plan = system.generate_content_plan(days=7)

# Execute the content plan
execution_results = system.execute_content_plan(content_plan)
```

### Generate a Weekly Report

```python
# Generate a weekly performance report
report_path = system.generate_weekly_report()
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- Internet connection for trend analysis and posting
- TikTok and Instagram accounts with API access

## Limitations

- The current implementation simulates API calls for demonstration purposes
- In a production environment, you would need to replace the simulation with actual API calls
- Content creation is limited to simple visuals and stock images
- Video creation capabilities are basic and would benefit from more sophisticated tools in a production environment

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced AI content generation
- Real-time analytics
- A/B testing for content optimization
- Content recycling
- Audience analysis
- Support for additional social media platforms
- Web-based user interface
